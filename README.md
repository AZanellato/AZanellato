### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a brazillian software developer, working professionaly with Ruby. 

I love reading - fiction and non-fiction.
I really value honest and candid communication and collaboration and empathy for people.
Everything we do involves social interactions and we need to be good to each other - tech is not apolitical.
